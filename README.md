# Excitability-Margin Model (EMM)
Unified computational framework for ventral CA1 excitability-margin collapse (ΔVmargin) and emotional replay dynamics across schizophrenia, depression, and PTSD.

This repository contains the reference implementation and all computational files underpinning the *Excitability-Margin Model (EMM)* as described in the preprint:

**Rosa, P. (2025). Ventral CA1 excitability–margin collapse as a unifying trigger of emotional replay in schizophrenia, depression, and PTSD (v4).**

## 🧠 What is the Excitability-Margin Model?

The **Excitability-Margin Model (EMM)** introduces  
a **single biophysical control parameter**:


ΔVmargin = Vthr - Vrest,


which determines whether ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons trigger:

- emotional replay
- fear/sadness/trauma neuromodulatory cascades
- circuit-level transitions into psychiatric phenotypes

EMM unifies:

- chloride transport adaptations (KCC2↓, NKCC1↑)  
- Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase shifts  
- EPSP gain modulation  
- CREB-high hot-spot excitability  
- human risk variants (CACNA1C, SCN2A, GRIN2A, etc.)  
- slow (days–weeks) biases from inflammation, microplastics, stress  
- ELF / geomagnetic phase perturbations (optional Axis F)

The repository includes **all computational components** used to model cumulative ΔVmargin collapse and predict risk trajectories.
